/**
 * Task 3:
 * Make this work (without using any built-in functions, only a for loop, return the next binary number in a string
 * or as an array).
 *
 * next_binary_number([1,0]) // [1,1]

 * possible test cases:
 *      [1,0] => [1,1]
 *      [1,1] => [1,0,0]
 *      [1,1,0] => [1,1,1]
 *      .......
 *      [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1] => [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0]
 *
 * Your solution:
 * if we type in our console your function and next_binary_number([1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]) then the result
 * should look like 1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0 (or as an array).
